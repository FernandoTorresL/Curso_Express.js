# Express.js Course, Platzi

## (Curso Express.js, Platzi, prof. Guillermo Rodas)

### Description

This project on /ecommerce folder is an independent project that begins at class #07 on Course Express.js

Develops an ecommerce from scratch to production, with a list of products, endpoints API, use of MongoDB, etc, using:

- MongoDB
- Bom, Joi
- Postman
- CSV load (products)
- Express (Node.js)

Here we created several branches using GitFlow method and integrated all on develop, and then on master

Right now (11 Jul 2020), we create **_release-1.0_** branch and integrated to **master** branch. Some features are in WIP status.

Some of the features that were implemented here:

- Use of pug, handlebars, template engine
- Implement Services Layer
- Connect to MongoDB
- Implement CRUD actions

This project begins copying the folder hello-world, like the professor did on the course on class #07
